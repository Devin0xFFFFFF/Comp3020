### Comp 3020 HCI Project

#### A Windows Forms application written in C# using Visual Studio

This repository consists of the University of Manitoba's Introduction to Human Computer Interaction course project.

The project was divided into three parts, the first two (A1, A2) being requirements gathering and wireframing.
Both also had a programming component, which was to get us familiar with C#, Visual Studio, and Windows Forms development.

This includes the following directories:
- Comp3020_A1-Part2
- Comp3020_A1-Part2b
- Comp3020_A1-Part2c
- Comp3020A2P3

The third part (A3) was developing the actual application based on the requirements and prototypes we developed earlier in the semester.

The source files are under [Comp3020A3](./Comp3020A3)

A compiled executable is located in movie_organizer.zip, just extract the folder and run the executable in a windows environment.
